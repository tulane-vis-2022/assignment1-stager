Write a short paragraph justifying the choices you made for color.

I think choosing color for a chart such as this one is less ambiguous than initially thought. By using colors similar to real world systems 
(such as a stop light), we can actually visualize that less is more. Red-yellow-green is an extremely common gradient used to illustrate
the change within a data set. By using a uniform interval for each perterbation, we can establish a solid use of color to display the difference
in GPA. While more colors could be used and the intervals would shorten, it would cheapen the value of each change in GPA, in addition to 1,2,and 3
all being common markers for a grade point average.

Write a short paragraph critiquing the effectiveness of the overall visualization. 

While I think this is a great starting point for a common data set such as this ones, there are clear limitations that exist within the visualization.
For example the restriction of dividing the ACT by a constant is undesirable, as the area of a circle grows at an increasing rate for increases in radius,
the visualization will be less effective for low radius values. The change in circle size is clearly hard to see. But trying to quell this and 
dividing by a larger constant causes the circles to overlap. Additionally, a more effective use of color could be to use a gradient that is based on 
infintessimal changes in the value of GPA. I also think that being able to include axes, keys, and grids could embellish a lot of the nuance that
exists within this model.
